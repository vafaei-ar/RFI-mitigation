**arch_?.py**s are the architectures. 

**mydataprovider.py** contains the data provider we used to feed the CNN. Pleaase notice that the data provider works in different modes based on the simulations we have. You may want to develope your own data provider.

**utils.py** contains some auxiliary fucntions.

The rest of the files are scripts to train either R-net or U-net on HIDE, MeerKAT and KAT7 datasets.
